    <h1>Interneting Is Easy</h1>
    <p>First,we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>
      Headings defines the outline of your site.There are six levels of
      headings.
    </p>
    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element(it stands for unordered lists)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They dont need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is what ordered list looks like</p>

    <ol>
      <li>notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>but,the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>
        you should be noticing things is this precise order,because this an
        ordered list
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Inline element</h2>
    <p>
      <em>sometimes</em>,you need to draw attention to particular word phrase
    </p>
    <p>
      other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance
      of a word or phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em>
    </p>
